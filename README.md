# üëã Hi! I'm Davide

## About me

I'm a **mechanical engineer** whose interests include programming, blockchain and other emerging technologies. I'm deeply interested in new technological innovations and in combining my solid mechanical engineering background with my growing computer science skills.

Previously, I have actively explored several personal and experimental projects, with a focus on **Bitcoin** and blockchain technologies. Currently, I am involved in a Bitcoin mining project, specifically experimenting with protocols such as Stratum and GBT (GetBlockTemplate). I run a personal Bitcoin node and regularly conduct tests and experiments, alternating between the *regtest* and *testnet4* networks. Additionally, I have developed **Python** scripts aimed at automating Bitcoin address generation in compliance with the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) standards. Parallel to these projects, I am independently studying **cryptography fundamentals** to deepen my technical understanding of Bitcoin technology.

My primary programming language is Python and I occasionally use **Docker containers** for rapid prototyping and in isolated environments, but only as a secondary tool.

I consider **Artificial Intelligence** an incredibly powerful resource and I use it daily to research technical problems, organize my ideas, develop new solutions and look for practical suggestions that facilitate the development of my projects. AI is also a valuable resource for debugging code and optimizing it. One of my aspirations for the next few months is to learn and adapt my AI usage strategies to improve my **problem-solving skills**.

My goals for the next few years include gaining more experience in the engineering field, improving my IT skills and integrating them into automatable processes. I am also considering changing my professional focus, focusing on Information Technology later in my career.

## üéì Education

Earned a Bachelor Degree of Mechanical Engineering from **Politecnico di Milano**.

Continued my studies and graduated with a Master‚Äôs Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the **University of Bologna**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Professional Experience

I am currently working as a **Design Engineer** at a company specializing in industrial plant design. My main responsibilities include:

- **3D CAD Design**: Developing detailed 3D models for industrial systems and components using advanced CAD tools.

- **2D Technical Drawing**: Producing 2D technical drawings required for the manufacturing process.

- **Layout Design**: Planning and designing industrial plant layouts to ensure optimal space utilization and workflow.

- **Site Inspections and Feasibility Assessment**: Conducting site inspections during the proposal phase to gather technical requirements and assess the feasibility of the project.

- **FEM Structural Analysis**: Performing advanced analyses using the Finite Element Method (FEM) to verify the structural integrity, safety and reliability of the designs.
